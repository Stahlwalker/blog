Here is what I've learned so far:

I've spent the last 4.5 months attending a Northwestern University Web Programming Bootcamp and here are a couple key takeaways for those interested. 

While attending this Bootcamp, I have been doubling down on Udemy courses to further understand the why we program this way and that way.  Northwestern does a good job of showing you the how but not necessarily the why.  The Bootcamp alone isn't enough, and the idea that it's for beginners is misleading.  For those looking to learn web programming, I'd suggest taking an online Bootcamp on Udemy for $20 versus the financial investment of a six-month program.  

If I could go back and do things over again, I would have spent more time on pre-work.  I don't think it was emphasized enough that you should have basic knowledge of x,y,z.  If I had a time machine, I would have taken a Udemy Bootcamp prior to the physical Bootcamp at Northwestern.  

The pros regarding Northwestern's Bootcamp fall on the workload.  Students are forced to put in the work at an incredibly face pace.  With online bootcamps students can learn at their own rate, it doesn't work that way with a 6-month program.  

It's important to know that because this program is only 6 months, they do run on a pretty strict schedule.  If you think you are going to get all your answers questioned you are mistaken.  They simply do not have the time to stay on one subject for too long.  That is where the how comes in and not the why.  There simply isn't enough time.  I think less activities and more teaching would be better suited for this program, but that is personal opinion.  My advice, bulk up a lot prior to taking a Bootcamp and I mean a lot.  The more you know the better because it is definitely not a beginnerâ€™s course.  Lastly, enroll in an online Bootcamp that mirrors the Bootcamp you are taking in order to get the how and not just the why.  Take it from someone who has spent the last couple months playing catch up with online tutorials and attending "office hours" before each class.  It is not enough to take one, you need a little bit of both.
