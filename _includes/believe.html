          <h2>What is Stahlwalker?</h2>
          <p>I started Stahlwalker because I wanted to build on my digital skill set.</p>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve been tasked with project managing the digital components of each marketing campaign. Project managing was just the tip of the iceberg, I wanted to dive deeper and gain access to the keys to the kingdom. In order to do that I had to tackle coding. Having a programming background enhances my ability to not only project manage but make the changes necessary to improve one’s brand recognition digitally. Stahlwalker is a company that benefits from years of marketing and web programming experience.</p>
          <p>Digital marketing and web programming is the way of the future, and it is Stahlwalker’s goal to bring those two services closer together.</p>
          <p>Take a look at some of my most recent work.</p>
