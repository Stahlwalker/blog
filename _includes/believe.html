          <h2>Technology is constantly evolving</h2>
          <p>I started coding because I didn't want to become a dinosaur.</p>
          <p>I can't believe I'm actually saying this but back when I was in college, social media was just starting.</p>
          <p>Digital marketing wasn't really a thing back then.  How was I to know this was the field I wanted to be in.  Now that I'm here, my goal is to continue to learn and adapt to the revolving door that is the tech industry.</p>
