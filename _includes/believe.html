          <h2>What is Stahlwalker?</h2>
          <p>I started Stahlwalker because I wanted to follow the ABC's of coding, ALWAYS BE CODING.</p>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve specialized in project managing the digital components of marketing campaigns. My goal was to move past project managing and become more technical. In order to do that I had to tackle coding. Having a programming background enhances my ability to not only project manage but make the changes necessary to improve one’s brand recognition digitally. Stahlwalker is a company that benefits from years of marketing and web programming experience.</p>
