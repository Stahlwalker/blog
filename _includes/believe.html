          <h2>What is Stahlwalker?</h2>
          <p>I started Stahlwalker because I wanted to build on my digital skill set.</p>
          <p>Stahlwalker is a company that benefits from the many years of marketing and web programming that I bring to the table. Throughout my career, I’ve been tasked with project managing the digital components of each marketing campaign. Project managing is just the tip of the iceberg, I wanted to dive deeper and be given the keys to the kingdom. In order to do that I had to tackle coding. Having a programming background enhances my ability to not only project manage but make the changes necessary to improve one’s brand recognition digitally.</p>
          <p>Digital marketing and web programming is the way of the future, and it is the goal of Stahlwalker to bring those two services closer together.</p>
          <p>Take a look at some of my most recent work.</p>
